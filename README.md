# Stable Diffusion Auto Generate

This is a node script that calls an Automatic1111 sever to generate AI images in a batch process. It generates prompts by using a given set of possible tags, using randomly generated parameters with a defined range.

The purpose of this project is to constantly generate AI images, using different prompts and parameters, so that prompts, parameters, and output images can be compared to find the best combinations.

## Cloud Servers

There are also scripts to automatically start Google Cloud or AWS VM instances that are running Automatic1111.
